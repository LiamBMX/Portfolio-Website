# 🧪 My Portfolio

Welcome to my **open-source portfolio site**  
I’m not the biggest fan of `tsx`, but it got the job done faster. I’ll probably convert it to something else soon.  

This is a **temporary portfolio** I threw together after finally grabbing my domain (🎉). You're welcome to **clone, customize, and make it your own**. I’ll keep improving the design as time allows.

### 💡 Use It, Break It, Fix It
Feel free to:
- Fork the repo
- Customize it for your own use
- Open PRs or suggest improvements
- Laugh at my rushed code (but nicely)

### ⁉️ How to use
Its pretty simple to setup but for blogs to work you do need supabase connected.
So create a .env and fillout this info:
```
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=
```
Also setup "blogs" table with the following collums: id, title, slug, content, excerpt, image, published_at, created_at, updated_at.
