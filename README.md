# ðŸ§ª My Portfolio

Welcome to my **open-source portfolio site**  
Iâ€™m not the biggest fan of `tsx`, but it got the job done faster. Iâ€™ll probably convert it to something else soon.  

This is a **temporary portfolio** I threw together after finally grabbing my domain (ðŸŽ‰). You're welcome to **clone, customize, and make it your own**. Iâ€™ll keep improving the design as time allows.
