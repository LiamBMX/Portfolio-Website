People often ask me, *"What is MindBloom, and why did you make it?"*

The answer is: MindBloom is a productivity platform designed to overcome those boring productivity tools you see everywhere. MindBloom specializes in helping neurodivergent minds.

But how do we actually help people? MindBloom transforms productivity into something engaging, personal, and fun through our core feature, the virtual garden. Instead of just checking off task's users grow and nurture a digital plant. Each day the dashboard encourages you to login and complete your daily productivity goals in exchange for your plant's growth. We do this to help users with motivation with a sense of accomplishment and reward.

Why did I create this though? Studies show that around 20% of the USA has some type of Neurodiversity, as well studies show that most of the Neurodivergent community has some sort of struggle when it comes to being productive and staying organized.

MindBloom was designed to solve these problems by meeting people where they are, not where the world expects them to be.
